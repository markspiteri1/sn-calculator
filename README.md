## Tasks not completed

Unfortunately, due to a couple of reasons, I ran out of time and did not complete the following tasks
* the square function
* showing the last 5 expressions and their computed results: I would have achieved this with a queue data structure, where the last successfull operation would be enqueued, and dequeueing the oldest one, always keeping the length of the object of 5 elements
